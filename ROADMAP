= ROADMAP

This represents the direction Rubygame will be going in, but
keep in mind that specific details may change over time.


== 2.X.0 (_possible_ minor releases before 3.0.0)

=== Focus: Time

- New Events::Tick class with lots of information
  - Time since last frame, in both seconds and milliseconds.
  - Current time
  - Current framerate

- New clock class
  - Based on Ruby's timer (allows multi-threading).
  - Better framerate calculation algorithm
  - #tick returns an instance of Events::Tick.

=== Focus: Sprites

- New sprite system
  - New Sprite, Scene, and Camera classes.
  - More powerful and simpler to use.
  - Integration with the Chipmunk physics library.



== 3.0.0 (next major release)

- Backwards compatibility is broken:
  - Deprecated classes / methods retired:
    - Rubygame::Mixer module.
    - Rubygame::Mixer::Sample class. Use Rubygame::Sound.
    - Rubygame::Mixer::Music class. Use Rubygame::Music.
    - Rubygame::Surface.load_image method. User Rubygame::Surface.load.
  - Surface#get_at
  - Sprites::Group#collide_group

- Change Sprites::Group#collide_group to scrap the 'killa/killb' stuff,
  take a block instead.



== On the horizon...

- Polygon, circle, and other geometric primitives
  - Drawing, with styles?
  - OpenGL drawing?
  - Collision detection?
  - Physical shapes w/ Chipmunk?
  - Generate bounding Polygon from an image automatically?

- Path (Curve?) (graphs/plots for tracing position and other uses)
  - Can find the position N units along the path.
  - Can draw a line showing the path.
  - LinearPath (connect the dots, linear interpolation)
  - BezierPath (chain of continuous cubic Bézier curves)
  - CodePath (calculated from a code block)

- Effect (Action?)
  - "Attach" to an instance, does something over time.
  - E.g. moves a sprite from point A to point B over N seconds.
  - Many types of effects, easy to define custom ones.
  - Takes parameters: start/end time, others depending on effect.

- C equivalent of Rect.new_from_object (see rect.rb)
  - Screen#update (cannot pass object with rect attribute)
  - Screen#update_rects (same as above)
  - Why not just call the ruby function from within C?
